;2018-04-13 patch addresses (1.13 matchmaking update, timestamp 1523577612, date from https://steamdb.info/app/389730/history/)
;IGNORABLE means that all the addresses contained within the blocks are useless and can be left untouched because the bot would still work correctly after a patch regardless. The bot keeps working even if they are set to 0x0 (except movelist_size and expected_module_address). It won't work if they are removed though.
